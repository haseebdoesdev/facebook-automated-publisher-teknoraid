📌 Guidelines (follow strictly):
1. Start with a compelling hook (question, bold claim, or surprising fact).
2. Follow with a 2–3 line summary of what the article offers and why it’s valuable.
3. Add a clear call to action (e.g., “Read now,” “Check it out,” “Explore the guide”).
4. Include 3–5 relevant hashtags (mix broad + niche).
5. Use emojis sparingly for readability and engagement.
6. Do NOT repeat the blog post title word-for-word.
7. Keep it short: 80–150 words total.
8. Output only the Facebook post — no headers, markdown, or extra notes.

Now write the Facebook post based on the blog input.
